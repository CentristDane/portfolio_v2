# Dane Sherrets Portfolio

I am passionate about finding ways to leverage technology to improve our political system. I began my career by helping campaigns and organizations communicate their message online which made me want to learn how to build the digital tools I was using. 
            
 In 2018 I graduated from George Washington Universities Web Development Bootcamp where I learned how to build full-stack apps with: JavaScript, HTML, CSS, jQuery, Chart.js, GeoJSON, Leaflet, React, Bootstrap, ES6, React VR, Git, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, MySQL, RESTful APIs, and Agile Development.

 I am always looking for opportunities to learn, grow, and use my unique skill set. If you want to build something to change the world then letâ€™s talk!
